## üåü Executive Summary: Cost Optimization and Scalability

This project is an **interactive visualization and planning tool** for the next generation of the Wezu Smart Battery System architecture. The central goal is to transition from a high-cost, vendor-locked (Azure-heavy) model to a **Cloud-Agnostic, cost-optimized** platform built on Kubernetes and Polyglot Persistence.

The proposal demonstrates a **60% reduction in cloud infrastructure costs** by leveraging specialized open-source solutions like TimescaleDB, Neo4j, and Kafka for IoT data handling.

## ‚ú® Key Features of the Interactive App

The front-end application provides a navigable roadmap across several key areas:

### üí∞ Cost Comparison & Savings
* **Visual Data:** Bar charts illustrating cost differences between the current and proposed architectures across MVP, Growth, and Scale phases.
* **Total Savings:** Projected savings of over **$157,000** in the first two years by optimizing data services.

### üó∫Ô∏è Agile Development Roadmap (8 Weeks)
Detailed 2-week sprints across four parallel tracks:
1.  **Agile Feature Roadmap:** Integrated Customer App and Admin Portal feature development.
2.  **Technical Roadmap:** Backend services, Kubernetes infrastructure, and database integration.
3.  **UI/UX Roadmap:** Design and user experience delivery.
4.  **AI/ML Roadmap:** Predictive Maintenance and Fraud Detection model deployment.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Architectural Decisions
* **Clean Architecture:** Principles are applied to ensure maximum testability, maintainability, and independence from cloud vendors.
* **Polyglot Persistence:** Utilizing the "right tool for the right job":
    * `TimescaleDB`: Optimized for high-volume battery telemetry (time-series).
    * `Neo4j`: Used for complex relationships (Battery ‚Üí Customer ‚Üí Station) and fraud detection.
    * `PostgreSQL`: Used for secure, transactional data (Rentals, User Accounts).
* **Cloud Agnostic:** Leveraging Kubernetes, Kafka, and Open-Source tools to guarantee portability across AWS, Azure, or GCP.
